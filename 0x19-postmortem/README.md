Example Postmortem: Website Application Outage
Date and Time of Incident: March 8, 2024, from 10:30 AM to 12:45 PM (UTC)
Summary:
On March 8, 2024, our website application experienced an unexpected outage, rendering the service unavailable to users for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes. The outage was caused by a combination of factors, including a misconfiguration in the load balancer and a sudden increase in traffic due to a marketing campaign.
Timeline of Events:
10:30 AM (UTC): The marketing team launched a promotional campaign, resulting in a significant spike in website traffic.
10:35 AM: The increased traffic triggered a surge in requests to our servers, causing the load balancer to become overloaded.
10:40 AM: The load balancer misconfiguration exacerbated the issue, leading to a cascading failure across the application servers.
10:45 AM: Users began reporting issues accessing the website application.
11:00 AM: The DevOps team identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer as the primary cause of the outage.
11:15 AM: Attempts to manually adjust the load balancer settings to mitigate the issue were unsuccessful.
11:30 AM: The decision was made to scale up additional application servers to handle the increased traffic.
12:00 PM: The additional servers were provisioned and configured, gradually restoring service to users.
12:45 PM: Full service restoration was confirmed, and the website application resumed normal operations.
Root Causes:
Misconfiguration in Load Balancer: The load balancer was not properly configured to handle sudden spikes in traffic, leading to overload and subsequent failure.
Insufficient Scalability: The infrastructure lacked sufficient scalability to accommodate the unexpected increase in traffic generated by the marketing campaign.
Impact:
Loss of revenue due to downtime during peak traffic hours.
Negative impact on user experience and brand reputation.
Increased workload for support and engineering teams during the incident.
Lessons Learned:
Automated Scaling Policies: Implement automated scaling policies to dynamically adjust server capacity based on traffic patterns.
Load Testing: Conduct thorough load testing prior to marketing campaigns or other events likely to generate significant traffic spikes.
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues more quickly.
Documentation and Communication: Ensure clear documentation of infrastructure configurations and improve communication protocols during incidents.
Action Items:
Update Load Balancer Configuration: Review and update load balancer configurations to optimize performance and resilience.
Implement Auto-Scaling: Implement automated scaling policies to dynamically adjust server capacity based on traffic demand.
Conduct Load Testing: Schedule regular load testing to identify potential scalability issues and ensure the infrastructure can handle anticipated traffic spikes.
Enhance Monitoring and Alerting: Implement additional monitoring metrics and configure alerts to provide early detection of infrastructure issues.
Documentation Review: Review and update documentation for infrastructure configurations and incident response procedures.
Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions for relevant teams to improve incident response processes and communication protocols.
